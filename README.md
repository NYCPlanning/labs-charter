# Charter - NYC Planning Labs 
 
This document defines the mission, values, responsibilities, roles, and governance of NYC Planning Labs.  It will be modified from time to time as needed.
 
## Dual Mission
  
1. To design and build modern, lightweight, sustainable, and impactful technology products that support the mission of the Department of City Planning
 
2. To implement and promote the use of agile methods, human-centered design, and open technology to support the above, maximizing the benefits of community-driven product development
 
## Core Values
 
*Open By Default* – Labs is committed to openness and transparency, and all activities will be open by default.  We will adopt the open source policy of 18F as a foundational set of principles to build upon.
 
*Build With, Not For* – Labs is a design partner, working closely with its customers in visioning and agile development.  Customers are expected to provide resources for the duration of a product build, and will be heavily involved in sprint planning and feature acceptance.
 
*Ship Early, Ship Often* – Labs’ preferred projects will yield a minimum viable product in 4-6 weeks, providing a rapid cadence and the opportunity to work on diverse projects and problems across the agency.
 
*Document and Disseminate* – Labs will place a high priority on documentation and outward messaging in support of its mission to promote modern technology best practices, and will manage its own web content to include general information about the team’s mission and work program, blogging, docs, and social media engagement.
 
## Project Scope & Project Selection
 
Labs Projects should be limited in scope to practically achieve the 4-6 week build deadline assuming the labs team’s full strength is dedicated.  The Labs team will maintain a public listing of project ideas, where anyone may contribute comments and feedback.  

*Project Selection Criteria TBD* - Labs will develop a clear and open process for selecting potential projects, to be appended to this Charter.
 
## Reporting
 
In addition to maintaining general team status information on Labs' website through project profiles and supporting blog posts, the director of Labs will brief the CIO and COO monthly on current project status, milestones, achievements, failures, lessons learned, etc.
